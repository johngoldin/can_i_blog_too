excerpt: "My existing blog uses blogdown/hugo/apero. Because hugo does not use pandoc, I'm unable to take advantage of all the features of quarto. As I convert to a quarto website, I'll try to describe the process in this post."

During the course of this blog since the first post in 2016, I have written multiple entries each time I have made a major change in how the blog was created. In [2018](/blog/2018-07-i-m-back.qmd) I connected Netlify to the Github Pages version of the blog and acquired the name johngoldin.com via Netlify. In [2021](/blog/2021-05-a-new-look-may-2021/) I converted to the Hugo theme apéro which allowed for a considerable reorganization of the blog and a better appearance that involved much more use of images. I should thank [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com) for creating apéro and nudging to inject a bit more life into my blog. And then along came [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

I have written a couple of posts that used [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/hugo.html) rather than Rmd. Quarto has been easy to pickup and blogdown/Hugo always had a lot of disadvantages. During my Hugo/blogdown period I was always confused about whether to use .md, .Rmd, or .Rmarkdown. I was always frustrated by the RMarkdown features that were out of reach because I needed to be compatible with Hugo. One of the big things I missed was code-folding. Anyway, after RConf 2022 I felt an irresistible pull to convert my blog to Quarto.

I started on August 16th, and as I write this it is September 5th and I feel close to being able to switch johngoldin.com to point to the Quarto version. I think it's basically in good shape. I'm still checking on Hugo shortcodes (usually figures) that haven't converted. I have made an effort to organize things so that the old URLs may still work, but one last step will be to fill in some more aliases in the YAML and maybe add some redirects to my Netlify setup.

The examples in the [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) have been a great help. In general the Quarto documentation has been a big help. As usual when I started out it took at lot of reading and re-reading the documentation and examples to understand a few core things. The crucial step for me was to understand [Document Listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html). Once I got that straightened out, I was on my way. I had a surprising amount of difficulty figuring out how to set the image that accompanies the post reference on the listing page. I didn't realize right away that depends on the "image" item in the YAML at the start of each post.

Because I don't have much in the way of actual readership, it's easy for me to make huge changes in the blog without fear of disturbing anyone.

The sections that follow are really just notes I acumulated while I figured out how to do the conversion.

## Examples

I'm collecting examples of blog sites done in quarto.

## Gotchas

I noticed an interesting difference in handling of images. I had a post that had two similar images. In the finder, each showed a size of 2560x1920. For the first image I inserted it into the post using raw html:

`<img src="img/john-weight.png" alt="Plot showing daily weight with periods during use of LoseIt to count calories hightlighted in yellow."/>`

For the second image, I used markdown syntax:

`![](img/john-weight.png){alt="Plot showing daily weight with periods during use of LoseIt to count calories hightlighted in yellow."}`

When I rendered the Rmd version the two images appeared the same in the browser. But when I rendered them using the quarto, the first image (using html img) was way too big. I changed the first image to also used markdown syntax and it looked fine. I image this has something to do with scaling the image and maybe appears on a mac. Or actually I should acknowledge that I don't know what caused this. The moral of the story for me is that with quarto maybe it's safer for me to use markdown syntax rather than raw html.

In the quarto version when I use markdown syntax to insert the image, in the html it ends up as class=img-fluid (which is a Bootstrap css class). In the html created using by blogdown rendering the Rmd file, no class is applied. Maybe there is other setup html in the blogdown version that interacts with the Mac rretina esolution and cuts down the photo. One can see that I'm trying to discuss something that I don't know enough about to fully explain or understand.

## Customizing Your Blog

[Albert Rapp](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html) has a lot of concrete information about setting up a Quarto blog, but also how to do some customizations. He has some very specific suggestion on use the renv package to [preserve the package environment](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html#make-posts-robust-with-renv) for each blog post.

## Hugo "slug" Yaml

In blogdown/hugo I made extensive use of the "slug" item in yaml to simplify the eventual URL for a blog entry. For example, routinely I'd use the year and month rather than year and month and day. Plus I sometimes shortened long folder names. Quarto knows to use slug if the type is Hugo, but it doesn't seem to use slugs if you publish from Quarto directly. This is not a big problem, but it means that I may want to add an alias to each post or maybe start using "redirects" in Netlify.

I already have a bunch of aliases from when I converted to the Apéro theme in Hugo.

This reminds me that it's a big advantage that I don't have a big audience for my blog. It means there is less pressure to nail down every detail. But I will need to think about the small number of places where I have published URL's to make sure they will still work. The most important is the information entry for my talk at RConf2022.

Another YAML item: In Hugo/blogdown, I can have the draft item and set it to false. In Quarto it seems that if the "draft" item is present, the post will not be included regardless of whether it is set to true or false.

## Putting Images in the Margin

I took the trouble of re-working my items on [Walking in Britain](/collection/walking-in-britain/) to use the class `.column-margin`. I think it makes the text flow much better. I quite ignorant of CSS and related HTML so working on some of the details of the formatting has pushed me to get a little bit better understanding of how things like CSS classes work.
