I also attended the Tidyverse developer day on the Friday after the conference and did my first Pull Request (PR). Soon I will be able to type `?forcats::fct_reorder` and see my own super-simple example added to the help for that function.\n\nThe videos from the conference are now [online](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020). It's impressive how much video content RStudio has online at their [resources site](https://resources.rstudio.com) including video from all the past conferences. There's a lot of useful stuff there.\n\nMy favorite talk of the conference was the [keynote by J. J. Allaire](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rstudio-open-source-software-for-data-science-j-j-allaire), the co-founder of RStudio. It was relevant for the world way beyond R and RStudio. Starting at about minute 25 he gets into issues about the motivation and incentives of for-profit corporations. He gets deeply into the issues. One does not expect to see a slide with the title \"Dodge v. Ford Motors (1919)\" at a computer conference. The subject that is addressing is relevant way beyond the computer industry. RStudio is a fascinating company and J.J.'s talk made it clear how much of the personality of the company comes directly from its founder.\n\nThe other Wednesday morning keynote was also excelent. Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg of Google delivered a very polished and interesting talk on [Data, Visualization, and Designing with AI](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/data-visualization-and-designing-ai-fernanda-viegas-and-martin-wattenberg). It got into the topic of issue of what \"fair\" and \"biased\" mean in the context of machine learning based decision algorithms.\n\nSome other talks I enjoyed:\n\nA talk on the [rayshader package](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader-dr-tyler-morgan-wall) had a lot of graphical \"Wow!\".\n\nI enjoyed William Chase on [The Glamour of Graphics](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/the-glamour-of-graphics-william-chase).\n\nThere were several heavy duty sessions on sports analytics including [this one](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/putting-the-fun-in-functional-data-a-tidy-pipeline-to-identify-routes-in-nfl-tracking-data-dani-chu) on NFL route tracking. And see [this one](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/r-tidyverse-in-sports-namita-nandakumar) as well.\n\nI always find talks by Jenny Bryan to be very rewarding. She's my go-to source for miscellaneous practical tips on a number of R subjects I care about, such as her [Happy Git book](https://happygitwithr.com) and [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf). The title of her talk was [Object of type 'closure' is not subsettable](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable-jenny-bryan), a message that every R coder encounters eventually. The talk addressed how to debug R code.\n\nBecause many sessions were presented in four parallel tracks, I want to go back and watch some of the sessions I missed such as [Making a tidy dress](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/lightning-talk-dr-amelia-mcnamara) by Dr. Amelia McNamara.\n\nOf course there were lots of sessions and not all of them were great. But there was a lot of good content.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% figure src=\"me_at_the_hex_wall.png\" alt=\"A nice figure\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
