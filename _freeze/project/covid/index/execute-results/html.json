As a result, I'm not updating the data regularly.\n\nI started publishing this in as a blog post in June 2020. Each weekday I\nwould update that post with the data from Connecticut state sources. The\nblog format never made sense for doing a frequent update of that type of\ndata. I have moved the daily charts into *Projects*. The original post\nremains.

One\nindicator of that is to estimate the parameter R<sub>t</sub>, the\naverage number of people who become infected by an infectious person.\nWhen R<sub>t</sub> is greater than 1 the number of daily new cases is\nincreasing, If R<sub>t</sub> is less than 1, it is decreasing. See the\nsite [covidestim · COVID-19 nowcasting](https://covidestim.org) for an\nestimate by state of the effective value for R<sub>t</sub>. The site is\ndescribed in [this\narticle](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/21/21227855/coronavirus-spreading-by-state-instagram-effective-reproduction-rate)\nat Vox.com. I don't claim to have the expertise to evaluate the quality\nof the calculation of R at the [covidestim](https://covidestim.org)\nsite, but it seems to jive with other information about the pattern of\nthe epidemic among states.\n\nI have included R<sub>t</sub> for Arizona as well as Connecticut to\nprovide a contrast with a state that has lately shown [signs of a\ngrowing\noutbreak](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-medical-experts-alarmed-over-surge-in-covid-19-cases).\nThe goal in Connecticut and in the entire New York City area is to keep\nR<sub>t</sub> well under 1. As of\n02/27/2022 R<sub>t</sub> is\n0.54.\nOn the other hand, in Arizona R<sub>t</sub> is about\n0.67.\n\n## Comparisons with Other States\n\n### Estimate of R<sub>t</sub> by State (from [covidestim · COVID-19 nowcasting](https://covidestim.org))\n\nThe next display shows the trend of R<sub>t</sub> in each state arranged\naccording to geographic position in the US. Remember that R<sub>t</sub>\nis a measure of the rate of increase. When R<sub>t</sub> is greater than\n1 the number of daily new cases is increasing, If R<sub>t</sub> is less\nthan 1, it is decreasing. The color of the R line shows whether the most\nrecent estimate of R for a state is [above 1 (purple\nline)]{style=\"color: #af8dc3\"} or [equal or below 1 (green\nline)]{style=\"color: #7fbf7b\"}. <br/><br/>\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Estimate of R<sub>t</sub> by State](index_files/figure-html/p-rt-map-1.png){width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br/> R is estimated from the state data and the gray area around the\nline indicates the statistical uncertainty of the estimate showing an\n95% confidence interval. Note that this map shows only whether\ntransmission seems to be growing or shrinking. How concerned one should\nbe about the epidemic in a particular state also depends on the\nprevalence of cases.\n\n### Trends in New Cases by State\n\nThe next map shows the history of new cases in each state per 100K of\npopulation. The lines are color coded the same as in the previous map to\nindicate whether the most recent estimate of R for a state is [above 1\n(purple line)]{style=\"color: #af8dc3\"} or [equal or below 1 (green\nline)]{style=\"color: #7fbf7b\"}. <br/><br/>\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![New Cases per 100K by State](index_files/figure-html/p-states-map-1.png){width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br/> The tallest graphs of new cases per 100K of population are New\nYork and Arizona.. From the point of view of someone living in\nConnecticut, the striking thing is how thoroughly Connecticut (and New\nYork, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts) have recovered from\nthe peak. New cases are low and the low value of the estimate of R\nconfirms that they are likely to decrease even more. The great contrast\nis with the increase of cases in some of the southern states.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n## Connecticut Covid-19 Deaths and Cases by Age\n\n::: {style=\"float: left; width: 50%; padding: 5PX;\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Covid-19 Deaths by Age](index_files/figure-html/deaths-by-age2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {style=\"float: right; width: 50%; padding: 5PX;\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Covid-19 Cases by Age](index_files/figure-html/deaths-per-100k2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<br/>\n\nDeaths increase with age, as has been well known since the beginning of\nthe epidemic. For cases, the number of cases per population stays\nrelatively flat from 20 to 79 and rises very rapidly for the oldest\ncategory. I haven't examined this data closely, but I assume this\npattern is related to the high rates of mortality in nursing homes. For\nthe age range from 60 to 79 there probably are a lot of seniors who are\ngoing to a great deal of trouble avoiding places and situations where\nthere is risk of catching the virus. But individuals in nursing homes\ndon't have that much control over their own lives. I would guess that\nthe older population outside of nursing homes has a lower rate of\ncatching the virus and the population inside nursing homes has a higher\nrate. The two trends may average out to a rate that is the same as\nmiddle aged adults. This is just speculation. I haven't dug into the\ndata to say anything firm about this\n\n## Nursing Homes\n\nI discussed nursing homes and prisons in the post last June. I have not\nbeen updating that data since the summer.\n\n## Variations by County in Connecticut\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNext I'll look at variations within Connecticut. Below are two maps\nshowing the eight counties in Connecticut[^1]. The first map in Figure\n\\@ref(fig:county-maps) shows the cumulative total of cases since the\nstart of the epidemic. The second map shows only new cases reporting\nduring the last two weeks. On both maps, cases are adjusted to show\ncases per 100K of population. So the first map relates more to the total\nimpact of the disease over the full course of the epidemic to date, and\nthe second map is an indication of the recent prevalence of the virus.\n\n[^1]: The data displayed on these maps excludes the towns of Somers,\n    Brooklyn, and Montville because they are small rural towns with\n    prisons, and the cases reported in the prisons may dominate the\n    total in the town and even affect the reporting for the county\n    overall. Covid-19 in prisons is a significant issue, but it's\n    helpful to try to evaluate it separately from data from the\n    non-prison community.\n\nConnecticut is part of the epidemic's surge in the New York area and the\nmagnitude of the epidemic has been greater in the counties closer to New\nYork City. Back in March cases first appeared in Fairfield County and\nthen spread to Litchfield, New Haven, and Hartford. More recently\nHartford has been the area that we have to watch.\n\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![County Maps of New and of Cumulative Cases](index_files/figure-html/county-maps-1.png){width=50%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![County Maps of New and of Cumulative Cases](index_files/figure-html/county-maps-2.png){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### By County and Type of Town\n\nThere are 169 towns in Connecticut, which makes it hard to examine\nvariations by town. To help examine variations within counties, I'll use\na typology of towns called [The Five\nConnecticuts](https://ctdatahaven.org/sites/ctdatahaven/files/UConnCPR%20Changing%20Demographics-5%20CTs%202004.pdf)\nthat divides towns into five categories based on census variables: Urban\nCore, Urban Periphery, Suburban, Rural, and a fifth category for Wealthy\nSuburbs used for some towns in Fairfield County. Adjusting for\npopulation, the number of cases has been greater in the counties closer\nto New York City. In the figure below I'll fold the wealthy towns into\nthe Suburban category. I have excluded Montville and Somers because the\nprisons in those towns complicates interpretation of the town\nstatistics.\n\nCounties are laid out from top to bottom and the counties closer to New\nYork are toward the top. The columns show the four categories. Urban\ntowns have been hit harder than suburban and rural towns. While density\nmay have some effect on case rates, the report [Towards Health Equity in\nConnecticut: The Role of Social Inequality and the Impact of\nCOVID-19](https://ctdatahaven.org/reports/towards-health-equity-connecticut)\nby DataHaven documents how the epidemic interacts with existing social\ninequality in Connecticut. <br/>\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='1.2'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cases by County](index_files/figure-html/county-by-category-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Details by Town\n\nThe links below take you to a separate HTML page for each Connecticut\ncounty. That page contains a table with one row for each town in the\ncounty.\n\nFor each town it shows the category, the population, the total number of\ncases to date, the number of recent cases per 100K of population (total\nnew cases in the last two weeks), total deaths, and the percentage of\ntotal deaths in that town attributed to nursing home residents.\n\nNext there are two [sparklines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline)\nthat show the trend in daily new cases and daily deaths (based on 14 day\nmoving average). Cases and deaths are shown as a ratio to population in\nthe town.\n\nThe purpose of these tables is to make it easier to quickly scan for\ntrends in local towns. Here is sample (based on my home of Guilford)\nshowing what is available for each town.\n\nFor each county there is also a map showing the towns in that county and\nthe relative number of total cases in the town and a second map that\nshows the percentage of individuals who are below the poverty line.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe town sparklines at the right show the trends over time. The vertical\nscale is different for new cases and for deaths. For new cases, the\nmaximum height shown on the scale is 100 while\nfor deaths, the maximum value shown is 28.6.\nFor both new cases and deaths, the sparkline shows the rolling seven day\naverage of new cases or deaths.\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div><table class=\"table table-condensed\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> town </th>\n   <th

As a result, there tends to be a \"day of the week\" effect. For\nthat reason, observers of the Covid-19 statistics generally focus on a\n7-day rolling average of the daily counts. Some of the unusually large\npeaks and valleys in these charts are due to reporting process. The DPH\nhas also begun producing reports based on the [date a sample was taken\nfor a\ntest](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Number-of-COVID-19-Cases-by-Date-of-Specimen-Colle/xz44-6swc)\nand [by the date of\ndeath](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-associated-deaths-by-date-of-death/abag-bjkj).\nThat's a more accurate way to look at the change over time, but it means\nthe data for the most recent days are hard to interpret because some\ndata may be \"in process\" and not yet reported. In these charts I have\nused \"date of report\" rather than \"date of sample taken\" or \"date of\ndeath\" because that gives me all of the recent data that is available\nand because that is what most other data projects (such as the COVID\nTracking Project or the New York Times) have been using.\n\nThe DPH reports always include a comment that \"all data are preliminary\nand subject to change.\" But when they make and adjustment to correct\nerrors, as far as I can tell they do not go back and adjust the earlier\nreports. That can lead to a misleading report of recent changes. For\nexample, in one note below they removed 70 cases because of errors on a\nday in which there were 81 new cases. In the data series that I\ndownload, that shows up as having been 11 new cases that day, not 81,\nbecause 70 were removed. Earlier days are not corrected.\n\n[Note as of June\n1](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary6012020.pdf?la=en)\n\n> \\*In Connecticut during the early months of this pandemic, it became\n> increasingly clear that it would be necessary to track probable\n> COVID-19 cases and deaths, in addition to laboratory-confirmed (RT-\n> PCR) cases and deaths. This was needed to better measure the burden\n> and impact of this disease in our communities and is now part of the\n> national surveillance case definition for COVID-19. Today for the\n> first time, DPH is reporting cases and deaths as \"confirmed\" or\n> \"probable.\" Previous reports reported these as a combined number. The\n> only change today is that they are being separated to conform with CDC\n> reporting guidance. Probable cases of COVID-19 involve persons who\n> have not had confirmatory laboratory testing (RT-PCR) performed for\n> COVID-19, but whose symptoms indicate they are very likely to have a\n> COVID-19 infection. In Connecticut, most of the probable COVID-19\n> cases involve persons whose death certificates list COVID-19 disease\n> or SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of death or a significant condition\n> contributing to death.\n\n[Note as of May\n27](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary5272020.pdf?la=en)\n\n> The staff at the Department of Public Health have removed 356 cases\n> and 808 tests in the past 24 hours, which were identified as\n> duplicates in the system, affecting both test and overall case\n> numbers. Since yesterday, there have been 341 new positive cases, and\n> 5,215 new tests were reported.\n\n[Note as of June\n18](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary6182020.pdf)\n\n> Please note that 81 new cases were reported in the past 24-hours; 70\n> previously reported cases were removed from the total counts due to\n> correction of data errors.\n\nIn the data portal, the number of cases reported for Montville was 381\non June 17. As of June 18 it reports 293 cases, a reduction of 88 cases.\nThat's more than the 70 cases removed. Perhaps the case counts for\nMontville were affected by inmates being moved within the Connecticut\nprison system.\n\n[Note as of June 24,\n2020](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary6242020.pdf)\n\n> 1175 new test results were reported since the last report and 2770\n> previously reported PCR tests were removed due to correction of data\n> errors.\n\n[Note as of July 23,\n2020](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary7232020.pdf)\n\n> \\*Please note 83 new cases were reported to DPH since yesterday. In\n> addition, 74 previously reported cases were removed due to updated\n> laboratory findings of false positive results.\n\n*July 24, 2020*: [Governor's press\nrelease](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2020/07-2020/Governor-Lamont-Coronavirus-Update-July-24)\n\n> \\*NOTE: Today's update includes a large set of data provided by an\n> out-of-state lab on tests that were conducted on Connecticut residents\n> between May 23 and July 20 and not reported to the State of\n> Connecticut until today. This data set provided by the out-of-state\n> lab includes approximately 12,000 tests, 440 of which were positive.\n> The remaining 104 positive cases in today's report are newly reported\n> cases in the day-to-day update, giving a 0.79% positivity rate for the\n> day.\n\nSee also [Hartford Courant, July 24,\n2020](https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-daily-numbers-0724-20200724-cqtkcw4zzraenoz5kbw5wxckmy-story.html)\nI don't see any explanation of this in the Department of Public Health\nPDF, but it was clear that an increase of 544 cases in one day would be\nremarkable.\n\n> On Friday, the state also announced a backlog of unreported test\n> results for Connecticut residents dating back to mid-May. Among these\n> approximately 12,000 tests, 440 were positive. On Thursday, the state\n> reported an additional 13,000 tests. With the 544 new cases, the state\n> has now recorded 48,776 coronavirus cases.\n\n[July 29, 2020 press\nrelease](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2020/07-2020/Governor-Lamont-Coronavirus-Update-July-29)\n\n> \\*In addition to the 79 recently diagnosed cases and 12,367 tests, 384\n> cases and 750 tests performed between April and June were newly\n> reported to the Department of Public Health in connection with a\n> transition to electronic reporting by an out-of-state regional\n> laboratory. For surveillance purposes, that data has been added to the\n> total case and total test counts.\n\n[Note as of August 18, 2020 DPH daily\nupdate:](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary8182020.pdf)\n\n> \\*Forty new cases were reported to CT DPH since yesterday; in\n> addition, DPH removed 52 previously reported cases because of newly\n> identified data errors.\n\n[Note as of October 12,\n2020:](https://www.fox61.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/governor-lamont-covid-19-update-connecticut/520-57baa88a-fbe8-47f3-9d06-600b2222d96a)\n\n> As of Monday, there were additional 1,066 positive cases from Friday.\n> That included over 270 positive cases out of 23,130 tests conducted\n> between September 26 and October 8 that are newly reported as part of\n> catch-up reporting.\n\n[Note as of September 30,\n2021:](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary9302021.pdf)\n\n> Today's total deaths reflects an increase of 146.
